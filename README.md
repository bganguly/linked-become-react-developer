this is a series of short examples taken from the 'become-react-developer' pathway on linkedin **but updated to use React 18.x throughout**.  
this specifc branch is on basic usage of react components and generally maps to the 'react essentials' chapter   
some examples are taken from the react website  
and some are original having been built using the official react documentation and the linkedin course as learning examples.
